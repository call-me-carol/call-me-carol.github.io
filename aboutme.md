## Fun Facts

-   My grandparents and parents met skiing, so I was raised to be a
    life-long skier.
-   An aspiring naturalist. My favorite wildflower is the
    [Pasqueflower](https://fieldguide.mt.gov/speciesDetail.aspx?elcode=PDRAN0K020).
-   Currently, my favorite book is *The Reign of Wolf 21* ([link
    here](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/49496785-the-reign-of-wolf-21)).
    It reads like Game of Thrones, but with actual wolves in Yellowstone
    National Park.
